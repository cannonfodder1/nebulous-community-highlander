# Nebulous Community Highlander

Often, modding support for a game doesn't extend as far as the community for that game would like. Highlanders are special mods that do not add any new features or content to a game, but instead are focused on making it easier for other mods to be created or allowing mods to co-exist with each other. 

Highlanders have their name because the changes they make to a game's structure are often far-reaching and incompatible with other mods making similar changes, resulting in the community clustering around a single mod of this kind rather than having many such mods. There can only be one, thus, 'Highlander'.

### Installation

1. Download BepInEx here: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
2. Install BepInEx by unzipping it inside your game folder. The structure should be `steamapps/common/Nebulous/BepInEx/core`.
3. Run the game to the main menu, then quit. There should be more folders inside `Nebulous/BepInEx`.
4. Download the latest version of the Highlander from here: https://github.com/cannonfodder1/nebulous-community-highlander/releases
5. Place `CommunityHighlander.dll` inside `Nebulous/BepInEx/plugins`. All done!
