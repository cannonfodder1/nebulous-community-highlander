# Nebulous Community Highlander

Game folder: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Nebulous`
Workshop folder: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\887570\2663519024`

If you installed Steam in a non-default location, the above paths are likely incorrect.

### Installation Instructions

1. Copy the "BepInEx_x64_5.4.16.0.zip" file in the workshop folder (see above).
2. Locate your Nebulous game folder (see above) and paste the .zip file there.
3. Install BepInEx by unzipping that file inside your game folder. The structure should be `Nebulous/BepInEx/core`.
4. Run the game to the main menu, then quit. More folders should have appeared inside `Nebulous/BepInEx`.
5. Copy the "CommunityHighlander.dll" file in the workshop folder.
6. Paste `CommunityHighlander.dll` inside `Nebulous/BepInEx/plugins`.
7. Run the game to the main menu, you should see "Highlander" with a version number in the top left.
8. Enable the Community Highlander mod in the "Mods" screen. Installation complete!

### Update Instructions

1. Make sure Steam's downloaded the new update. You can force the download by starting up Nebulous.
2. Grab the new `CommunityHighlander.dll` file from the workshop folder. You can right-click -> Properties -> Details if you want to check its version number.
3. Copy-paste it into your `Nebulous/BepInEx/plugins` folder. All done! The highlander version number on the main menu should be updated once you restart the game.
