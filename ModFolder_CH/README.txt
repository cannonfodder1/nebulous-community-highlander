# Nebulous Community Highlander

Game folder: usually `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Nebulous` unless you installed Steam somewhere else.
Workshop folder: this text file you're reading is inside it.

To check if the Highlander is properly installed, try adding or removing mods using the in-game mod manager.
If the highlander is working, the game will say it is EXITING, instead of RESTARTING.

### Installation Instructions

1. Copy the "BepInEx_x64_5.4.16.0.zip" file in the workshop folder (see above).
2. Locate your Nebulous game folder (see above) and paste the .zip file there.
3. Install BepInEx by unzipping that file inside your game folder. The structure should be `Nebulous/BepInEx/core`.
4. Run the game to the main menu, then quit. More folders should have appeared inside `Nebulous/BepInEx`.
5. Copy the "CommunityHighlander.dll" file in the workshop folder.
6. Paste `CommunityHighlander.dll` inside `Nebulous/BepInEx/plugins`.
7. Run the game to the main menu, you should see "Highlander" along with a version number in the top left.
8. Enable the Community Highlander mod in the "Mods" screen. Installation complete!

### Update Instructions

1. Make sure Steam's downloaded the new update. You can force the download by starting up Nebulous.
2. Grab the new `CommunityHighlander.dll` file from the workshop folder.
3. Copy-paste it into your `Nebulous/BepInEx/plugins` folder. All done!
